## What's Next
1. Feasibility: as the inverse of reachability, this might be a better thing to port to other systems
* * backwards-in-time solutions work, start on precomputing derived state + extra work for flappers
2. Cleanup code for Github + Readme
3. Take another stab at CSV-file based serialization / deserialization of sims
4. Take start state from config file or CLI
5. Take system params from config file or CLI
